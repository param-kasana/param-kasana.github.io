            <h3>Social Network Analysis</h3>
            <p>
              This project centers on conducting Social Network Analysis (SNA) within the FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) movement. 
              The objective is to reveal noteworthy insights, identify patterns, and recognize influential figures in the FIRE community. 
              Employing diverse tools and techniques, the analysis primarily delves into social media and network analysis. In addition to methods 
              employed in a prior project, Network Graphs were utilized to scrutinize social networks, pinpointing communities, significant nodes, 
              and the spread of influence.</p>

            <h3>Sentiment Analysis for BMW</h3>
            <p>
              This initiative is centered on examining Reddit data to explore inquiries linked to BMW, leveraging social media for market research. 
              The project encompasses the entire data science process, spanning data collection through the communication of findings. Key learning 
              objectives involve the application of data science techniques to scrutinize social media and networks, incorporating Natural Language 
              Processing (NLP) for discerning sentiment and topics. The ultimate aim is to present insights derived from social media and network 
              analysis to a prospective client who may not be acquainted with social media analytics. In this context, the project serves as a valuable 
              tool for conducting market research on behalf of BMW and showcasing the capabilities of social media analysis.</p>

          <h3>Movie Recommender System</h3>
          <p>
            Within this collaborative filtering project, I tackle a range of recommendation tasks, encompassing user-based (leveraging KNN-based Collaborative 
            Filtering) and item-based filtering (using KNN), while also introducing an innovative solution to elevate the quality of recommendations. The 
            technologies employed in this endeavor include Python for implementation, Scikit-Learn for machine learning, Surprise for constructing and analyzing 
            recommender systems, Jupyter for interactive development, and Git for version control. This project goes beyond the fundamental aspects of 
            collaborative filtering, venturing into cutting-edge solutions to enhance movie recommendations. It provides a comprehensive perspective on the 
            landscape by utilizing a diverse set of technologies and tools.</p>
